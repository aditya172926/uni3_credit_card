Uni3 is a digital credit card that allows people to borrow money from their family, friends,
co-workers or connections. This enables the peer network that financially backs one another
and earns a passive income as lenders.

## <p align="center">Specifications of the Project</p>
Dapp allows to borrow USDC and other ERC20 tokens.<br>
Other Erc20 tokens support will be implemented with their wrapper addresses such as WBTC, WETH, etc.

Borrowers earn an interest based on the number of installments paid in upon the principle amount. The split payments are as follows
 - 1st installment - Interest Rate = 1%, Treasury Fee = 0.5%
 - 2st installment - Interest Rate = 2%, Treasury Fee = 1.0%
 - 3st installment - Interest Rate = 3%, Treasury Fee = 1.5%

Currently the repayments are done in the same token as the one used to borrow. The lenders can use **Uniswap widget modal** integrated to Swap their ERC20 tokens to desired tokens.

Users can switch between Polygon and Ethereum testnet.
